# Dietary App for Healthcare 
### By Thomas Tai



### Introduction

A dietary aid is typically responsible for preparing food for residents and patients at long term assited living facilities and hospitals. There are strict requirements for meals to ensure they meet dietary requirements, do not contain allergens, and of course satisfy any preferences (i.e halal, vegetarian, pescetarian) that the patient has. At many facitilies, it is too easy to accidentally make mistakes when there are hundreds of patients to account for and limited staffing. 



### Proposal

We will develop an app that can assist patients with dietary restrictions and give lists of safe foods and unsafe foods. In addition, chefs will be able to select from a list of safe food recipies. For a better user experience, we can make it linkable to a patient's electronic health record and allow nurses or other staff to update medication lists. 

By restricting the scope of this project to only be used by healthcare employees, it can be reasonably completed in the span of this 14 week course. Developing this software would allow employees to achieve higher efficiency and allow better processing of patient information.
